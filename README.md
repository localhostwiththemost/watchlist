# watchlist

A movie watchlist application I built utilizing the OMDB API, which allows the user to search for movies and then save/remove them from their watchlist.

## Purpose

I built this project to further develop my understanding of JavaScript's fetch API and learn how to properly create and display dynamic elements on the page.

## Technologies Used
